Add a new Expense Management module under Master → Expense Type in the existing HRMS web app.

1. Expense Type Master Setup

Allow creation of dynamic Expense Types (e.g., Travel, Food, Accommodation, etc.).

For each Expense Type:

Allow selection of Roles & Levels (e.g., Jr. Manager, Sr. Manager, Top Management).

Allow defining expense limits based on Role/Level.

Example:

Jr. Manager (Travel per KM) = ₹10/km

Sr. Manager (Travel per KM) = ₹20/km

Top Management (Travel per KM) = ₹30/km

For Travel expenses specifically, enable a field to capture distance travelled via Google Maps integration (start & end location → auto distance calculation).

Add checkboxes for:

“Bill Mandatory” – makes bill upload required for that expense type.

“Manager Approval Required” – marks expense type as needing approval before payment.

2. Employee Expense Submission

Employees can log their expenses under “My Expenses.”

Each entry includes:

Expense Type (dropdown)

Date

Amount (auto-limited by role & expense rules)

Optional Google Maps distance (for Travel)

Bill Upload (if mandatory)

Remarks/Description

Show total claim summary per employee and month.

3. Manager Approval Workflow

Reporting Managers have a view of their team’s submitted expenses.

Each expense can be Approved or Rejected with remarks.

Once approved, status updates automatically for Admin visibility.

4. Super Admin / Sub-Admin View

Under Expenses → Admin Dashboard, show all expense claims with filters:

Status: Pending Manager Approval, Approved (Awaiting Disbursal), Disbursed/Paid.

Employee, Department, Date Range, Expense Type.

Allow export to Excel/PDF.

Option to mark expenses as “Disbursed/Paid.”

5. UI / UX

Use the same design components and layout as the existing HRMS (consistent theme and UI behavior).

Tabs:

Expense Types

My Expenses (Employee view)

Manager Approvals

Admin Overview

Include status indicators and progress icons for each expense stage.

Ensure all screens follow existing component style and navigation flow.
