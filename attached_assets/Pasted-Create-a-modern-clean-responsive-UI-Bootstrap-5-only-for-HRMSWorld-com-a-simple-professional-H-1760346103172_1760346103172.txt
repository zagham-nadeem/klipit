Create a modern, clean, responsive UI (Bootstrap 5 only) for HRMSWorld.com, a simple, professional HR management system.
This is a UI-only project (no backend logic) ‚Äî just static HTML/CSS pages styled with Bootstrap and a sleek black-and-green theme (black for backgrounds and text accents, green for buttons, highlights, and interactive elements).

üè† Home Page with Interactive Cost Calculator

Design a Home Page that introduces HRMSWorld.com with a headline, product highlights, and a Cost Calculator section where users can estimate their subscription price.

Calculator Logic (UI simulation only):

Input: ‚ÄúEnter number of employees‚Äù (numeric input).

Calculation rules:

If entered employees < 10, calculate as 10 employees minimum.

If 10‚Äì25 employees ‚Üí ‚Çπ225 per employee/month.

If 25‚Äì50 employees ‚Üí ‚Çπ200 per employee/month.

If 50‚Äì100 employees ‚Üí ‚Çπ150 per employee/month.

If 100+ employees ‚Üí display message ‚ÄúContact our Sales Team for customized corporate offers.‚Äù

Upto 10 employees (minimum) ‚Üí ‚Çπ275 per employee/month (paid annually).

Output: Show cost per employee, total annual cost, and ‚ÄúContact Sales‚Äù or ‚ÄúRequest Demo‚Äù button.

UI-only functionality: use front-end input, calculation, and display animation (no backend logic).

Include:

CTA buttons like ‚ÄúGet a Quote‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequest Demo.‚Äù
